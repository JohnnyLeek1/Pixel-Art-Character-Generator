# Pixel Art Character Generator

Created as a component of our Senior capstone project, [Colin Truemner](https://github.com/CJT157) and I created
this quick generator to create modular pixel art characters. These are intended to showcase the different clothing
combinations that an avatar can have as part of our platform!

It it implemented in React.JS using an HTML canvas component, and is highly reusable and extendable to many different
clothing styles and options!
